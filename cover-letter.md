Dear Sir/Madam,

This letter is to express my interest in regards to the ....front end developer...... position,
hoping to become the newest member of your engineering team.
I looked through the requirements that you mentioned and they match very well my skill 
areas, experience and attitudes. 

I love to solve problems, splitting them in small ones and finding solutions that are simple and reusable. 

I have experience and passion for contributing to all phases of the development lifecycle, 
interacting with designers, back-end developers and project managers. 
I am confident that I can bring it into your company as well.
I enjoy working in a team as well as working independently in office or remote.

I look forward to discussing this position with you in more detail. 
Thank you for your consideration.

Iâ€™ve attached a copy of my resume that details my experience, along with my portfolio website.
